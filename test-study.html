UNIT 1
1) Dichotomous keys 
How to make a dichotomous key (the actual diagram, the key (5))
Binomial nomenclature (genus species)



2) Phylogenetic trees and cladograms 
Difference between phylogenetic tree and cladogram 
(cladogram general, no specific time, lets us see when each species adapt the characteristic, phylogenetic tree shows acquired time )
Clades: taxonomic group showing all common ancestors 
Able to read a it 

Able to make one 

3) Biological diagrams and protists 
Make/read a biological diagram 
What they are (animal-like, fungi-like, plant-like)
Protists:eukaryotic, 1.5 billion years ago, most unicellular, produce sex/asex, lives in water and damp areas
Prokaryotic vs eukaryotic
Pro: nucleus not membrane, often unicellular, no membrane bound organelles, asexually 
Euk: nucleus membranes bound, often multi, membrane bound organelles, sexually 

4) Structures of virus and bacteria
Virus structure: capsid, genetic material, sheath, tail fibers, small
How it helps with what it does: very small, protects capsid dna from exposure, easier to spread and affect cells as viral are smaller than regular cell
Bacteria structure: cell wall, membrane, ribosomes, cytoplasm, DNA, plasmid, pilli, flagellum
How it helps with what it does: walls provide structure and protection, maintain shape, no burst, helps reproduction

UNIT 2
1/4) Stages of meiosis and mitosis
Determine the stages for each
What happens in each stage 
Compare 3 similarities and differences between the 2
Similar - create new cell, begin with 1 parent, same basic steps (PMAT)
Difference - meiosis creates genetic diversity, sexual, haploid (1n), gametes cell
			      - meiosis identical genes, asexual, diploid 2n, somatic (body) cell
Goes wrong??? (cancer v mutations)
Male is spermatogenesis, makes 4 sperm cells. Female is oogenesis, makes 3 polar bodies and one egg.

2) Karyotype/Disorders 
What's a karyotype and why is it important 
Determine the gender (XX, XY)
Determine the disease and what chromosome is it (dup, trisomy, deletion, monsonomy)
Different mutations based on chromosome (down syndrome(21), klinefelter (XXY), patau (13), turners (X), edward(18), cri du chat(5), pallister killian(12))
Causes of it (nondisjunction, genetics (runs in the family))

3) Punnett squares 
Practice, monohybrid, co-dominance.incomplete dominance, sex-linked, multiple alleles (blood)m dihybrid (16)

5) Blood type lab 
Genotypes for each blood type
Blood information ( universal donor/recipient)


6) Determine the DNA sequence/mutation 
Determining the complementary pairs (Adenine and thymine, guanine and cytosine)
Types of point mutation (base-pair substitution, insertion and deletion)
3 types of mutation (spontaneous, induced, chromosome)

UNIT 3
1) Evidence of evolution 
Fossils??? (ask)
3 Evidence Darwin Found (biogeography, anatomy, embryology)


2) Natural selection gizmo lab 
What is natural selection, who came with it (darwin), how used today 
4 steps of natural selection 
(variation, selective pressure, survival of the fittest, gradual change)
Able to explain each stage, with example >
Know a example, look at test example

3) Homologous/analogous/vestigial features 
Darwin's evidence of anatomy 
Homologous - same origin, different function (bat wings, human arms)
Analogous - different origin, same function (bird and insect wings)
Vestigial - non-functioning part, homologous, same origin - cave fish 


4) Types of selection (ask)
3 types of natural selection (directional, stabilising, directive)
Directional - favours the extreme variation trait (giraffe)
Stabilizing - favours most common variation trait (human-birth-weight)
Disruptive - (W) favours most/least favoured, at opposites (calm-size)

5) Reproductive barriers 
Reproductive isolation mechanism, 2 types (prezygotic and postzygotic)
Prezygotic (behavioural, ecological temporal, mechanical gamete)
Postzygotic (zygotic mortality, hybrid inviability, hybrid infertility)

Bonus: just know just in case, 3 patterns of evolution 

UNIT 4 
1) Digestive, Respiratory, Circulatory 
Know the 3 systems and each systems function 
Digestive System: System focusing on digestion and absorption of food 
Respiratory System: System focusing on gas exchange/breathing of us 
Circulatory System: System focusing on blood circulation throughout body 
Know the organs of the system and the basic functions of each 
Routes
Digestive, mouth, teeth/saliva break food, bolus down esophagus, stomach mixes acid, small intestine (enzymes), accessory organs help (liver, gallbladder, pancreas), absorption, large intestine, waste in rectum till released the anus
Respiratory, Air breath through nasal passages, pharynx, larynx, trachea, bronchi, bronchioles, alveoli, gas exchange, reverse
Circulatory, cardiac cycle, atira relax fill with blood, atria contracts and ventricles fill with blood, ventricles contract and squeeze blood out same time atira release 
Be able to compare similarities and differences between systems
Also how the 2 systems work together 
Digestive and Respiratory 
breathing provide O which helps digestive tract work, nutrients to help respiratory function properly
Digestive and Circulatory 
Work together, circulatory system transports nutrients obtained, nutrients to help organs function properly/better 
Respiratory and Circulatory 
Work together, respiratory brings O in and exchanges it into the blood system for CO2 which goes out (transport O), brings blood to and from the lungs

Similarities and differences for 

Digestive and Respiratory 
Nervous system, Work together, same region of mouth/upper throat where food/air can get mixed, 
Digestive and Circulatory 
Work together to supply nutrients around body, organs require nutrients, nervous system
Respiratory and Circulatory  
Both worry about oxygen transportation, both wanna remove waste (CO2), nervous system

2) Diagnose the disorder (all systems) 
Know all the disorder for each system, be able to identify them 
Digestive: heartburn, stomach ulcers, crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, constitution, appendicitis, cirrhosis, gallstones
Respiratory: Asthma, COPOD, influenza, tuberculosis, pneumonia, cystic fibrosis, smoking (3 components - nicotine addict, tar affects alveoli, CO affects hemoglobin)
Circulatory: increase cardiovascular disease, hypertension, arteriosclerosis, atherosclerosis, CAD, Angina, angioplasty, myocardial infarction, arrhythmia
